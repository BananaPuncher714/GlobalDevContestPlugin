# Spaaace
It's space!

### How to use
- Get elytra
- Fly to a height of over 500 at night between 14000 and 22000 ticks

You will need air to survive on the moon. Use a space helmet or find a sanctuary to breathe. Find sanctuaries using a compass.

### Comments
Unfortunately, reloading of the server will cause items to stop working. So please do not.

Also, gravity is a bit buggy, but that can't really be helped due to how Minecraft handles packets.
