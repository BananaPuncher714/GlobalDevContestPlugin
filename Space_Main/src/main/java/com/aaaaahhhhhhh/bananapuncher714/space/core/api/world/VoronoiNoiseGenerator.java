 * To use octaves, use the VoronoiOctaveGenerator class.

	/// Noise module that outputs Voronoi cells.
	///
	/// In mathematics, a <i>Voronoi cell</i> is a region containing all the
	/// points that are closer to a specific <i>seed point</i> than to any
	/// other seed point. These cells mesh with one another, producing
	/// polygon-like formations.
	///
	/// By default, this noise module randomly places a seed point within
	/// each unit cube. By modifying the <i>frequency</i> of the seed points,
	/// an application can change the distance between seed points. The
	/// higher the frequency, the closer together this noise module places
	/// the seed points, which reduces the size of the cells. To specify the
	/// frequency of the cells, call the setFrequency() method.
	///
	/// This noise module assigns each Voronoi cell with a random constant
	/// value from a coherent-noise function. The <i>displacement value</i>
	/// controls the range of random values to assign to each cell. The
	/// range of random values is +/- the displacement value. Call the
	/// setDisplacement() method to specify the displacement value.
	///
	/// To modify the random positions of the seed points, call the SetSeed()
	/// method.
	///
	/// This noise module can optionally add the distance from the nearest
	/// seed to the output value. To enable this feature, call the
	/// enableDistance() method. This causes the points in the Voronoi cells
	/// to increase in value the further away that point is from the nearest
	/// seed point.
